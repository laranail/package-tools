/**
 * Finds published files that nothing publishes any more.
 *
 * The gap this fills: every cleanup in this package is **destination-registry
 * driven**, so it can only remove targets something registered in the current
 * process. A package that has been uninstalled registers nothing, and its files
 * sit in `public/vendor` forever. So does the old copy of an asset whose
 * publish path changed.
 *
 * ## How it decides
 *
 * A plain set difference. Everything actually on disk under a prune root, minus
 * everything the currently-booted application would publish there.
 *
 * The expected set is built from **every** publish group, not only the ones
 * this package registered. That is the correctness hinge: Livewire, Horizon,
 * Filament and anything else publishing into `public/vendor` are legitimate
 * occupants, and a scan that only knew about laranail tags would report all of
 * them as orphans and offer to delete them.
 *
 * ## Why it is stateless
 *
 * No manifest, no ledger. A manifest would need to have existed before the
 * files did, which is exactly wrong for the case this exists to solve — the
 * files that are already there, from an install nobody has a record of. The
 * diff needs no prior state and is correct on its first run.
