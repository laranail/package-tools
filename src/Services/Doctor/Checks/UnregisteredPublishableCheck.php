/**
 * Reports directories that look like packages but registered no publish tags.
 *
 * ## What this catches
 *
 * An application with a `platform/modules/` or `packages/` tree adds a
 * directory, writes a provider, and forgets `->setPublishTagId()` or the
 * `hasAssets()` call. Nothing fails: the module works, and its assets simply
 * never publish. The symptom arrives later and somewhere else — a missing
 * stylesheet on one page, a config the operator "already published".
 *
 * The command this idea comes from tried to solve the same problem by scanning
 * those directories and **publishing** each one under a guessed tag name. That
 * is the wrong shape twice over: it invents a tag that may not exist, and it
 * writes files to answer a question.
 *
 * **This never publishes and never deletes.** It reads the directory listing,
 * reads the registry, and reports the difference.
